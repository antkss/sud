# sud(aemon)
# (modified version)

## What is this?

`sud` is a simplistic `su` daemon for Corellium, and maybe other, Android devices. It is older [Superuser](https://github.com/koush/Superuser) code, slightly refactored and heavily stripped down to the pure basics. Simply put, it will allow anyone who requests for `su` to be granted it. This is *not* something you should run on your personal device, this is a huge security issue. However if you want to test things or allow anything to run with `root` privledges, this is for you. This binary could also be easily modified to log all incoming `su` requests for such things as simplistic "taint" trace or watching what binaries use it for.

### Build

Building should be rather simple, simply create a `Makefile.local` file to properly point to you compiled of choice (`CC`) and system root (`SYSROOT`). These are located inside your Android NDK (`ANDROID_NDK`) directory for most people. You can check the `Makefile.local.sample` in this repository as an example. Once this is done, simply run `make`.

```
diff@larry:../sud/ $ make
~/Android/Sdk/ndk/20.0.5594570/toolchains/llvm/prebuilt/linux-x86_64/bin/aarch64-linux-android24-clang -o src/daemon.o src/daemon.c -c -O2 -Wall -Wextra -I./include/

~/Android/Sdk/ndk/20.0.5594570/toolchains/llvm/prebuilt/linux-x86_64/bin/aarch64-linux-android24-clang -o bin/su src/daemon.o src/pts.o src/su.o -llog 
diff@larry:../sud/ $ ls -l bin 
total 44
-rwxrwxr-x 1 diff diff 41416 Jan 21 13:31 su
```

Alternatively, check the releases tab for a precompiled `su` binary.

### Installing on Corellium Android Devices

Build the binaries in this repository following the directions in the `Build` section. Then on
the local machines connect to the device via `adb` and push the following files;

```
adb push init.sud.rc /data/local/tmp/
adb push bin/su /data/local/tmp/
```

Then get a `shell`, via `adb` and run the following commands;

```
su
/system/bin/mount -orw,remount /system
/vendor/bin/cp /data/local/tmp/su /system/xbin/su
/vendor/bin/chown root /system/xbin/su
/system/bin/chcon u:object_r:su_exec:s0 /system/xbin/su
/vendor/bin/chmod 06755 /system/xbin/su

/vendor/bin/cp /data/local/tmp/init.sud.rc /system/etc/init/init.sud.rc
/vendor/bin/chown root /system/etc/init/init.sud.rc
/system/bin/chcon u:object_r:system_file:s0 /system/etc/init/init.sud.rc
/vendor/bin/chmod 644 /system/etc/init/init.sud.rc

/system/bin/reboot
```

Note for Android 12 - there is no `/system` mount, so you will need to remount the root mount `/` instead. So replace the above mount with `/system/bin/mount -orw,remount /`
